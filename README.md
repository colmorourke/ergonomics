A virtual coach for rowing machine users

The goal of this project is to create a virtual coach for users of the rowing machine.
To achieve this, we first classify stages of the rowing stroke and then identify points of improvement. 

The algorithms behind this work combines pose detection with a classifier.

The pose detection algorithms were modified from two existing repos:
1. Openpose: https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose
2. tf-pose: https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation

The classifier, to classify stages in the stroke is currently under construction.
